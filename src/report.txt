Accuracy =  0.9438202247191011 (94.4%)


Question 2:
-----------
Accuracy =  0.9550561797752809 (95.5%)

The percentage for a k=1 is less than that of k=3

This is because the class is determined from the most frequent class
out of that items three nearest neighbors rather than its single
nearest neighbor. This improves the accuracy because it accounts
for situations where there is as outlier item very close to
another item with a different class. k of 3 will notice this and
ignore that single outlier piece of data.


Question 3:
-----------
Advantages include
- simple and easy to understand and implement making it a
good introduction to the topic
- immediately adapts to new training data as it is added
and is quick to get going as there is no actual "training step"

Disadvantages include
- unknown what the ideal number for k should be meaning it is
often unknown how to use the algorithm to its full potential
- doesn't adjust well to imbalanced, outlier or missing data
limiting the algorithms versatility


Question 4:
-----------
1. divide both the test and training data into 5 equal parts
2. first put the 1st set of test data in and 2nd-5th sets in of training
data
3. then put the 2nd set of test data in and the 1st and 3rd-5th sets
of training data into the program
4. continue on until the program has been run 5 times and all test parts
have been compared to the training data and you have all of the classifications
5. then average the results of those 5 processes and the output will be the
desired classifications from that K-fold cross validation


Question 5:
-----------
You would use the K-means clustering method with k = 3
1. puts 3 centroids randomly on the plane
2. for each point in the data find the nearest centroid (smallest euclidean
distance) and then assign that point to that centroid
3. for each cluster calculate a new centroid based on the mean of the
points that are assigned to that cluster
4. repeat 2 and 3 until nothing changes in the clusters assignments

Algorithm Accuracy =  0.76
Baseline Accuracy =  0.8125


The baseline accuracy is actually higher than the algorithm accuracy.
This is because the data set is highly imbalanced in favor of "Live" data

Question 2:
-----------
0 accuracy = 0.87
1 accuracy = 0.8
2 accuracy = 0.67
3 accuracy = 0.7
4 accuracy = 0.8
5 accuracy = 0.67
6 accuracy = 0.8
7 accuracy = 0.77
8 accuracy = 0.67
9 accuracy = 0.73

Average = (0.87+0.8+0.67+0.7+0.8+0.67+0.8+0.77+0.67+0.73)/10 = 0.748

Question 3:
-----------
a) "Any pair whose elimination yields a satisfactory (small) increase in impurity 
is eliminated and the common parent node becomes the leaf node" (Lecture notes)

There is pre pruning which is when you get to a certain branch and need to make the decision to 
branch or not based on how much extra accuracy you will gain by doing so. If you get to a branch
and it doesn't improve the accuracy by enough then you should "prune" that branch of the tree

And there is also post pruning which is where you create the whole tree and then search through 
it to figure out which branches are weak and don't need to be included. This method is more complex
but can lead to more robust results.

b) Because it makes the tree less specific to just that training set that is given
to the algorithm (pruning avoids over fitting your tree) making it less accurate on that
specific collection of data

c) Because after pruning the tree it becomes more general (less specific to just the training data) and
able to handle test data in a more dynamic and robust way


Question 4:
-----------
As defined in the lecture material the impurity equation is done with a collection of elements that
have 2 potential classes. This is because when the equation given is adjusted for 3 classes or more the output becomes
incorrect. For example in a hypothetical situation we have 3 classes, class 1 had 10 elements, class 2 had 10 elements
and class 3 has 0 elements, although this is an impure collection (as there isn't just one class present), because the
total value is multiplied by the 0 from class 3 the final answer will be zero which should indicate that the collection
is pure which is incorrect. This proves that with more than 2 classes the impurity equation given is invalid
